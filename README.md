# Epos
_The programming language of epic poetry_

Epos draws inspiration from [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Epos compiles to LLVM IR and is written in Go.

> NOTE: The Epos compiler requires Nix to build.

## Setup
- Run `nix build`

## Command to run
- Run `./result/bin/epos ./examples/hello.epos`
- Run `./build/hello`

## Notes/TODO:
- This is WIP
- Add static typing
- Eventually add macros
- Add stdlib
