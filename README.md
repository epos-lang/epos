# lua_llvm
_A LLVM compiler for Lua written Go_

## Notes:
- This is WIP
- I'm not a fan of starting counting at 1 so this starts at 0
- Currently, it does not have for loops (only while)

## Setup
- Run `nix build`

## Command to run
- Run `./result/bin/lua_llvm ./examples/hello.lua`
- Run `./build/hello`
